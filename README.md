## Why should I care about Search Engine Optimisation?
If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to
hear it, does it make a sound? If a website isn't
on the first page of a google search, does how good
it is even matter? :thinking:

The majority of traffic for sites still comes from organic searches (this means
people searching using normal search queries).

There is an increase in traffic coming from social
media and people sharing things, but the majority
is still coming from search engines. So you want to
make sure your site shows
up for the relevant queries, so that it gets optimum
traffic, and all of the benefits that come with it.

 You can make the best website in the world, but if _no one_ can find it, then it doesn't matter!

And being high up in searches matters! A study indicated that the first result
from a google search recieves 32.5% of clicks, where the second receives only
17.6%, that's almost half the traffic, due to only being one position lower!

## What is SEO?

Search engine optimisation is an effort to increase the traffic to a website by
trying to make sure it appears as high in the search results as possible for
searches related to certain queries.

Before looking into SEO too much it is useful to have a little understanding
of the way searches on the web work for which we really recommend [this short
video on how google searches work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNHR6IQJGZs).

By understanding the way that searches work, we can try to make sure that our
website has as high of a chance as possible to be high result in searches
relevant to our topic. It's still important to remember to keep
[User Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design)
at the heart of all of our decisions, and make sure we are not
compromising UX for the sake of SEO just as google themselves advocate:

> Search engine optimization is about putting your site's best foot
forward when it comes to visibility in search engines, but your
ultimate consumers are your users, not search engines.

## How do I do it?

A lot of SEO is making a clear site with good quality content that users will
engage with, but there are some basic tips you can do on your own site which
will make sure that search engines will show your site in relevant searches.

### Titles
`<title>Learn Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) - dwyl</title>`

First and foremost your titles should be useful and readable, not just a
collection of keywords. They should also be unique for each page (this helps
with search engines knowing that it's a different page).

The title tag should be contained within the `<head>` tag of the HTML
document, it is what will be displayed in the tab on your browser when the
page is open, and what the title of the entry in the search results will be.

Search engines generally only display the first **65-75** characters of the
`<title>` so it's best to make sure your title is within that limit. If you
_really_ need to have it longer to get an accurate title it may be
worthwhile, but at least make sure the first 65-75 characters give a good
idea of the page, so when the user sees the search result they get the idea
of what the page is. Depending on what you are trying to rank for,
it sometimes makes sense to place your brand at the beginning.

For best SEO, keywords should go close to the front, for example "Web
development agency" as opposed to "Fun creative agency specialising in web development".

### URLs
URLs play an important role in both user experience and search engine optimisation.
Luckily search engines are engineered to like the same types of url as humans,
so if you concentrate on keeping urls short and descriptive, it should translate
into great SEO.

#### Guidelines for a great URL
__Be descriptive:__ If you can't easily tell the purpose of a page from the
URL, you're probably doing something wrong.

__Use human-readable urls:__ Try to keep numbers, weird symbols and nonsensical
text to a minimum. Again, if the url isn't easy to interpret, _something is
wrong_.  

__Use keywords, but don't overuse them:__ If you're targeting a specific set of
keywords, including them in the url can help to improve search rankings. On the
flipside, if the url is _just_ a series of keywords with no relation to page
content, then search engines will sometimes tag the site as spam and ranking
will take a hit.

__Keep it short:__ Shorter URLs mean nicer links for emailing and inclusion on other sites. They also allow the whole url to be displayed with search results.

__Use hyphens to separate words:__ Underscores and other separators can be intepreted incorrectly by search engines. Hyphens (-) are the standard.

## Images
Search engine crawlers can't _see_ images unless they come with alt (alternative)
text :eyes:

Although it can be useful for SEO to include keywords in the alt text of images,
as with urls, this should __only__ be done if the words fit with the image.
First and foremost alt text should be a description of the image:

```
This:
<img src="/happy-squirrel.jpg" alt="A joyous squirrel eating an acorn." />
```
```
Not this:
<img src="/happy-squirrel" alt="Super cheap acorns sold here! Buy ten get one free" />
```
