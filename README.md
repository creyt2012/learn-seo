## Why should I care about Search Engine Optimisation?
If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to
hear it, does it make a sound? If a website isn't
on the first page of a google search, does how good
it is even matter? :thinking:

The majority of traffic for sites still comes from organic searches (this means
people searching using normal search queries).

There is an increase in traffic coming from social
media and people sharing things, but the majority
is still coming from search engines. So you want to
make sure your site shows
up for the relevant queries, so that it gets optimum
traffic, and all of the benefits that come with it.

 You can make the best website in the world, but if _no one_ can find it, then it doesn't matter!

And being high up in searches matters! A study indicated that the first result
from a google search recieves 32.5% of clicks, where the second receives only
17.6%, that's almost half the traffic, due to only being one position lower!
