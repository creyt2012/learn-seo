## URLs
URLs play an important role in both user experience and search engine optimisation.

### Guidelines for a great URL
__Be descriptive.__ If you can't easily tell the purpose of a page from the URL, you're probably doing something wrong.
__Use human-readable urls.__ Try to keep numbers, weird symbols and nonsensical text to a minimum. Again, if the url isn't easy to interpret, _something is wrong_.  
__Use keywords, but don't overuse them!__ If you're targeting a specific set of keywords, including them in the url can help to improve search rankings. On the flipside, if the url is _just_ a series of keywords with no relation to page content, then search engines will sometimes tag the site as spam and ranking will take a hit.
__Keep it short.__ Shorter URLs mean nicer links for emailing and including on other sites. They also allow the whole url to be displayed with search results.
__Use hyphens to separate words.__ Underscores and other separators can be intepreted incorrectly by search engines. Hyphens (-) are the standard.
